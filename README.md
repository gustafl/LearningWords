# Lexeme
This is a web application for computer-assisted language learning (CALL). While other CALL applications offer a prepared set of words and phrases, the vision behind Lexeme is being able to start with _any_ text in the foreign language. See the wiki for more information about the project.

## Status

The current status is pre-alpha and before first release. Release 0.1.0 will demonstrate a part of the planned functionality (translating words in a pre-defined text). See the milestones and issues for details on the progress.

## Technology

Some of the technologies used are HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, REST, JSON and MySQL.
