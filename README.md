# Lexeme
This is a web application for computer-assisted language learning (CALL). While other CALL applications offer a prepared set of words and phrases in the foreign language, Lexeme makes it possible to start with _any_ text. The user includes a foreign language text from any source and then translates it, word by word, into the native language. While the text is translated, words are added to the user's own lexicon, and light up wherever they appear in the text (or any subsequently translated texts). Translated words can be described grammatically, using a grammatical framework adapted to the foreign language. There will also be features in which registered words can be practiced in isolation. See the wiki for more information about the project.

## Status

The current status is pre-alpha and before first release. Release 0.1.0 will demonstrate a part of the planned functionality (translating words in a pre-defined text). See the milestones and issues for details on the progress.

## Technology

Some of the technologies used are HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, REST, JSON and MySQL.
